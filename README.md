# StarTunnel

In 2012, I made some album art for [Starring's ABCDEFG-HIJKLMNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ](https://starringmusic.bandcamp.com/releases) ([Northern Spy Records](https://northernspyrecords.bandcamp.com/)).  Three years later, I designed this little interactive JS tool so that you, dear reader, could make your own op-art star patterns.  A couple years later still, I ended up using the tool to design the cover art for my own [Not Knowing](https://alexness.bandcamp.com/album/not-knowing) series of artisinally time-stretched samples.

It uses [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui), which is nice.
